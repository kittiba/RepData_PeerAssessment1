        unzip("activity.zip", overwrite=TRUE)
}

#reading data
activitydata<-read.csv("activity.csv",header=TRUE)

```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### Used aggregate function to get the mean/median of the steps/day based on date
### Aggregate function ignores the NA values by default

```{r}

stepsPerDay<-aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activitydata,sum)

#Trying to plot
hist(stepsPerDay$steps)

#mean of steps/day
print(aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activitydata,mean))

#median of steps/day
print(median(stepsPerDay$steps))

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
